## About
Liftbuddy is a simple fitness app made to help you learn more about the art of weightlifting.  The app includes articles to learn from, a workout database with videos and form improvement articles, and a tracking page to log and keep track of your lifting sessions.

## Installation
There are two main ways to install LiftBuddy on to your phone. If you have an Apple Developer Account or used a service such as [UDID Registrations](https://www.udidregistrations.com) and are thus able to sideload more then 3 apps please use the iPA version.

However if that is not the case due to not wanting to take up extra space for sideloading apps there is a PWA option. The Progressive Web App is essentially a web based version of the LiftBuddy app and works just like the iPA version. This version is preferred since it will not be counted towards the 3 apps Apple allows for normal sideloading.

| Name          | Link          | Version |
| ------------- | ------------- | 1.1.2 |
| iPA  | [Install](https://github.com/AwaadCc/liftbuddy) | 1.1.2 |
| PWA  | [Install](https://awaadcc.github.io/files/liftbuddy.mobileconfig)  | 1.1.2 |

## Understanding Routines
The tracking tab allows you to save and load routines.

The save function will save a .json file on to your device.

This can be renamed to whatever but normal scheme is title of routine + date.

The load function will allow you to browse filesystem for file.

Only accepts .json and if not proper LiftBuddy routine format will not install properly.

Best way to use is to make a folder named Routines and save each routine there with an identifiable name.
