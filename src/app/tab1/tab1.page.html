  <ion-card-content>
   One of my favorite movements at the gym is called a farmer’s carry. You hold a heavy weight — for me, around 95 pounds — in each hand and attempt to walk with a solid, upright posture for between 30 and 60 seconds. <br>Once, while my workout partners and I were carrying, as we say, at our local YMCA, an older gentleman enthusiastically asked, “What’s it for?” I was quick to explain that farmer’s carries work your grip, core, arms, legs and even cardiovascular system — an utterly elegant full-body exercise. But the man wasn’t satisfied. “What’s any of it for?” he exclaimed, alluding to the two hours I spend repetitively moving iron every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning...

At some point, you’ve probably seen some dude come into the gym—he probably had a beard—load up a barbell with 45-lb. plates that the steel was literally bending, and sent shockwaves of awesomeness across the floor with some of the most impressive squats you’ve ever witnessed in person. And at that moment, you probably wondered: How in the hell do I do that? The answer: Powerlifting. Unlike bodybuilding, which emphasizes the pursuit of a particular physique, powerlifting is a sport of attaining as much raw strength as is humanly possible. Primal in its simplicity, powerlifting ain’t always pretty, nor is it especially glamorous. But it is practical, unquestionably hardcore, and a virtual guarantee you will never again struggle to move your couch...

    <ion-card-title>Just three seconds of weightlifting can improve muscle strength, ECU study shows</ion-card-title>
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
The study involved 39 healthy university students performing one muscle contraction at maximum effort for three seconds per day for five days a week over four weeks.

"In this particular study, we wanted to know the minimal stimulus for the muscle to get stronger," Professor Nosaka told Tom Baddeley on ABC Radio Perth.
The students performed either an isometric, concentric or eccentric bicep curl at their maximum effort while researchers measured the muscle's maximum voluntary contraction strength before and after the four-week period.

    <ion-card-title>Want To Lift Heavier? 6 Steps To Moving More Weight</ion-card-title>
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
Who doesn’t want to be stronger? It won’t happen overnight, but it will happen if you stick to a holistic process.

Ah, to be at home in my garage gym. Is there anything better? The smell of the rubber floor, the sound the bar makes during touch-and-go deadlifts, the way the plates bounce as you drop the barbell in victory … This really is my happy place.

And nothing makes my happy place better than hitting a heavy lift. But there is so much more to lifting heavy than simply loading up the plates and going for it. Making a PR lift, building muscle, getting stronger: these things take time. And patience. And yes, some failed attempts. The road to glory is paved with bumps, and I don’t mean bumper plates...

    <ion-card-title>Stronger muscles, longer life: Lifting weights for just 30 minutes a week lowers risk of death from all causes</ion-card-title>
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
Bigger muscles may be the key to a longer life. According to a study out of Japan, lifting weights at the gym or even doing some heavy lifting around the house for just 30 minutes a week cuts the risk of dying early by up to a fifth.

Prior studies show that building muscle is linked to a lower risk of death, but scientists had not probed what the optimal “dose” might be. Researchers from the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine report that muscle strength training for 30 to 60 minutes each week cuts the risk of death from heart disease, diabetes and cancer by 10 to 20 percent. And when combined with aerobic exercise...

  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
   Most of us know that strength training (with free weights, weight machines, or resistance bands) can help build and maintain muscle mass and strength. What many of us don't know is that strong muscles lead to strong bones. And strong bones can help minimize the risk of fracture due to osteoporosis.<br>
  A combination of age-related changes, inactivity, and inadequate nutrition conspire to gradually steal bone mass, at the rate of 1% per year after age 40. As bones grow more fragile and susceptible to fracture, they are more likely to break after even a minor fall or a far less obvious stress, such as bending over to tie a shoelace...
